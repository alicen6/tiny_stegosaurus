# Tiny Stegosaurus

I wanted to make a very simple and small stegosaurus that could be made easily by anyone, but still employed the use of fine cuts for complex bends. The final design is this 6" stegosaurus.

## Files

There are the original solidworks files, which can be used to adjust and change the model, as well as for putting together the final model.

The DXF files are used for setting up the cut for a laser cutter. You will need to nest the files, as I have not provided a nested file. Quantities are listed at the bottom of this README.

There is also an image to show approximately what the final model should look like.

## Materials

This is designed to be cut out of any 1/8" material. This can be wood, plastic, but metal may not be a wise choice.

The holes will accept a 3/16" dowel.

Some kind of adhesive will be necessary, I use superglue with wooden models, but epoxy could work as well.

## Process

Cut all parts with a laser, assemble with dry fits before using adhesive to finalize things in place.

The last thing to do is to glue the tip of the nose together and the tip of the tail together.
